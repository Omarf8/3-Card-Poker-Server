# 3-Card Poker Server

This is the server program for my 3-Card Poker program. This program creates a server for multiple clients to connect. It includes all necessary game logic, such as dealing hands, shuffling, determining hand types, and more.
A log is visible to track each step that a client takes. The 3-Card Poker Client program is necessary to play the game.
I'd like to revisit this program to make the code cleaner and also to improve the UI, and potentially add more features to track players at each point in the game.
